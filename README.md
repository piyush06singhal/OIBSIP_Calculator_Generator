# How the Project Works
The Calculator Generator works as follows:

1. HTML Structure: The HTML file contains the structure of the calculator, including buttons for numbers, operations, and the display area.
2. CSS Styling: The CSS file styles the calculator to make it visually appealing and ensures it is responsive to different screen sizes.
3. JavaScript Functionality: The JavaScript file handles the logic for the calculator. It listens for button clicks, performs the arithmetic operations, and updates the display accordingly.

# Example Workflow
1. User Input: A user clicks on the number buttons to input values.
2. Operations: The user clicks on an operation button (e.g., +, -, *, /).
3. Calculation: The user inputs the second number and clicks the equals (=) button to get the result.
